(just write the letter) Answer: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed  This would ensure that the tests run every time you make a change to your code base. This is essential because sometimes during development the developers might be under pressure and might push low quality code. However, to avoid such code to bring the overall quality of the app down, automated tests will enforce the developers to write and push high quality code.",
